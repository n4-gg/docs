### Changes

- **Added new config option: _consoleInfo_**
  > This allows you to toggle prints in the server console. True by default.
- **Added new config option: _stackPrio_**
  > This allows you to toggle whether you want to combine all rows/discord roles of priority points together or only use 1 row/discord role (being the one with the highest amount of points). True by default.
- **Added new config option under discord: _requireIdentifier_**
  > This allows you to choose whether you want to require players to have their discord linked to FiveM or not. True by default.
- **Added new config option under discord: _whitelist_**
  > This allows you to choose whether you want to enable a whitelist on your server or not. If enabled, players will need to have the discord role designated in the config to be able to connect. False by default.
- **Added new config option under discord: _whitelistRoleId_**
  > This is only used if the whitelist is enabled. This is where you input the role id of the discord role that you want to use when the whitelist is enabled.
- **New Command: _v-queue:wl_**
  > This command allows you to enable/disable the discord whitelist without having to restart the resource. Simply run the command and it will be set to true if false, or false if true.
